## Background

The intention of this project is to create somewhere central and shared where we can keep a list of technical meetups etc that happen in Manchester to make them more discoverable. My plan is that a group of people will be responsible for maintaining this project, and new meetups / alterations can be made by Pull Request to the JSON data.

Iâ€™ve put a few issues in to show what needs doing and would love to hear from people who can help.
