## Background

The intention of this project is to create somewhere central and shared where we can keep a list of technical meetups etc that happen in Manchester to make them more discoverable. The plan is that a group of people will be responsible for maintaining this project, and new meetups / alterations can be made by Pull Request to the [JSON data](http://manchester-tech-events.github.io/events.json).

There are some great lists out there already (see links on the website) but they are all associated with either an individual or a business. If this takes off it will be owned by an abstract community, with no names on it.

## Get Involved
