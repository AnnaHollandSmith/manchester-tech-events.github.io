## Background

The intention of this project is to create somewhere central and shared where we can keep a list of technical meetups etc that happen in Manchester to make them more discoverable. The plan is that a group of people will be responsible for maintaining this project, and new meetups / alterations can be made by Pull Request to the [JSON data](http://manchester-tech-events.github.io/events.json).

There are some great lists out there already. There is [Andrew Disley’s Mandigest page with a massive list of people and events](http://simplified.co.uk/mandigest/), [Gemma Cameron’s useful Google Calendar on her website](http://rubygem.me/events/), the [North West Digital Communities site with a Google Calendar](http://nwdc.org.uk/), [Manchester Digital, the paid for independant trade association](https://www.manchesterdigital.com/), [SpaceportX events listing](http://spaceportx.com/events) and the [Madlab events listing](http://madlab.org.uk/events/), but they are all associated with either an individual or a business. If this takes off it will be owned by an abstract community, with no names on it.
